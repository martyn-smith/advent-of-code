Advent of Code
===

My solutions to the problems posed by the wonderful chaps at [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

So far, nothing fancy here, invocation is by typing `python aoc<x>.py` at command line, each file printing the first then second answer to stdout. Challenges are grouped by year, and the data files are in the same directory as the src to keep things flat.

Tested on python 3.8.6 with no dependencies outside the standard library.
